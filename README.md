## 🎯 Project Goals

> “Write. Run. Refactor. Repeat.” — That’s the Codiline way.

Codediline was created with the following objectives:

1. 🧪 Build an intuitive **code playground** to create, run, and manage code snippets.
2. 🧠 Design a **smart editor** using **React + CodeMirror**.
3. 🧩 Implement a **responsive, modular layout** using **styled-components**.
4. 🌐 Integrate the **Judge0 API** via **RapidAPI** for code compilation and execution.
5. 🎨 Add **multi-theme support** (dark/light and more).
6. 📂 Allow users to **upload/download** code files.
7. ⌨️ Provide a dynamic **Input/Output Console**, with **text file upload/output export**.
8. 💾 Store multiple playgrounds using **localStorage**.
9. 🖥️ Add **fullscreen mode** for distraction-free coding.
10. 🤖 **AI-powered Python↔C++ code conversion** with binary instruction output _(Gemini Model Integration)_.
